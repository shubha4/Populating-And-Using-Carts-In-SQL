# Populating a Shopping Cart using SQL

This project showcases how I created and populated a database for a grocery store and included the functionality to provide each customer with a cart. If an employee chooses to process a cart, I have included stored procedures to support the necessary steps, such as removing the entry from the cart and adding it to the order table. Some additional functionality consists of using a synthetic transaction to ensure that the database is highly available and can process simulated customer behavior successfully.
